- 👋 Hi, I’m Brad Williamson. I'm from the United States, but I've been living in South Korea for over a decade. I'm a teacher with a background in psychiatry and research methods and statistics, so I decided to use those skills, along with my love of baseball, to learn and apply Python to statistical analysis.
- 👀 I’m interested in python, statistical analysis, graphing and visual representations, and baseball.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python3. I'm comfortable with html and css as well, but Python is where I've found the most joy and challenge.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to baseball.
- 📫 You can reach me here on github if you'd like to get in touch.
